# Blackjack

 Blackjack, also known as 21, has been one of the most popular casino games of the last hundred years and has spread throughout the world. 
 In the 21st century it has been overtaken in popularity by Slots (slot machine games), but it remains one of the most popular casino card 
 games and is available in almost all casinos both on and offline.
