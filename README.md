# JavaScript-Coding-Challenges

#### JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.

#### Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer
